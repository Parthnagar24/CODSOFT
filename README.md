🚀 Level 1 Task 1: Landing Page Development – Completed!
I’m excited to share the successful completion of my first web development project as part of my internship with CodSoft.
For this task, I built a responsive and visually appealing landing page using HTML and CSS. This hands-on experience helped me solidify my frontend development skills and understand how to create interfaces that are both functional and user-centric.
🔑 Key Learnings:
✅ Structuring content using semantic HTML elements like headers, sections, and footers
✅ Designing clean, responsive layouts using modern CSS techniques
✅ Applying CSS styling for alignment, spacing, color balance, and visual clarity
✅ Ensuring a professional, clean, and user-friendly design without layout overlaps
This project gave me the opportunity to translate theory into real-world practice and truly appreciate the importance of clean code, design principles, and usability.
